    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>Hello! I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/vladfr">Vlad</a>, nice to meet you!</p>
    <p>I'm a software developer and consultant. I play Hearthstone regularly, but I wanted to get into other card games as well. I thought of doing this newsletter to discover a new game with a good community and keep up to date. </p>


    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12 col-md-8 ml-lg-5 mt-2"  style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.9);">
            <h4>What kind of content will I get?</h4>
            <p>
                I plan to include the most relevant links &amp; updates from the community. These can be reddit posts, blog posts, developer updates, state of the meta etc.
            </p>
            <h4>I selected 2 games. What will I see?</h4>
            <p>
                There will be a General section with news from across the industry. Then, each game will have its own Section. You'll only receive the sections you signed up for.
                <br><br>I'll also include snapshots of other games being added, so you can track more games if you want.
            </p>
            <h4>I want free packs!</h4>
            <p>Me too, son, me too...</p>
