        <h3>It's always night in space</h3>

        <p>In the flying city-starship of Frivolity, all the residents are obsessed with the latest razzle-dazzle: <b>T</b>he <b>C</b>ard <b>G</b>ame.
        Battle with the denizens to take their cards, while exploring the city to discover it's mysteries.</p>

        <p>The game is played by two players on a single board. You play your cards in the hopes of linking them together to build combos. These combos
        can then be activated to deal damage, heal, shield or gain other kooky effects. </p>
