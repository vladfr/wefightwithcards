    <p class="first">
        The MTG: Arena team held a Q&amp;A session on Twitch about the upcoming beta. Nate sat down with
        Executive Producer Chris Cao to talk about the Beta schedule and what's coming early 2018.
    </p>

    <p>
        The beta invites started going out this week, and people started playing, but we won't see any streaming any time soon.
        They will open tests during the weekend, until they can reach 24/7 playability around <b>November 30th</b>.
    </p>

<div class="content">
    <h3>The Ladder and Sideboards</h3>
    <p>They confirmed the Ladder will be 1v1, single-game matches, or Best of 3 + Sideboard. You will be able to choose which Ladder you want.</p>

    <h3>Free-to-play</h3>
    <p>The team re-iterated their commitment to free-to-play. They want to make sure you'll be able to build a collection and play Ladder in a purely free-to-play fashion.</p>

    <h3>Cards and sets</h3>
    <p>
        Most cards from the Standard sets are already working, as far as rules are concerned, but they are missing design assets, such as animations and interactions.
        This is actually why we'll have to wait a bit more for another set.
    </p>

    <h3>Draft</h3>
    <p>They have been testing 8-player drafts, and this game mode will be available in the Closed Beta. There is no timeline for it at the moment.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>Beta schedule</h3>
    <p>They are starting with a Stress test on <b>November 3rd</b>, and add more play days in the following weekends. You'll be able to select one of a few pre-made decks and battle it out with other players.
        We expect the decks to be similar to the ones showcased so far, like the above U/R Sorcery played at the <a href="https://go.twitch.tv/videos/183273509">community deck showdown</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        After that they'll expand the beta and release more features. This will happen before the end of November.
    </p>

    <h3>Beta NDA and feedback</h3>
    <p>The invite emails will contain clear instructions about the NDA and what you need to do to be able to play.</p>

    <p>The basic rules: don't post anything publicly on social media or other outlets. This means no screenshots, videos, streaming or tweets.</p>

    <p>You will be able to download a special installer, which will get the rest of the game. As far as feedback is concerned,
    you'll receive instructions on how to provide it. The whole idea is not to post anything publicly while the game is under NDA.</p>
