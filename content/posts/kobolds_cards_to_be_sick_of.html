        Kobolds and Catacombs is the latest Hearthstone expansion, due to launch on December 7. It features a sleuth of new cards that are bound to shake the meta.
    </p>
    <p>Among them are the new Legendary weapons, powerful one-of's that promise to bring back weapon-hate cards, and Spellstones, cards which get free upgrades as the match progresses. </p>
    <p>But I thought I'd take a look at the new staples: common or rare cards that you'll see time and again, cross classes and archetypes. You know, like <em>Bonemare</em>. </p>

    <h3>Dragons</h3>
    <p>
        Dragon Priest is about to become very strong, and most of this is due to this one very powerful Rare. A good board clear <b>plus</b> a 3/3 body is sweet!

    <p>
        The core class mechanic is <b>Resonate</b> &mdash; cards with Resonate can activate special abilities and effects when there is an even number of cards in your deck.
    </p>
    <p>Right alongside that are <b>Artifact</b> cards &ndash; token cards you can add either to your deck, or to your hand, so you can more easily activate Resonate cards. </p>

    <h3>Rotation and Unlimited</h3>

    <p>
        With the release of the 7th Shadowverse set in December, you'll be able to play in two game modes: Rotation and Unlimited.
    </p>

    <p><b>Rotation</b> will only allow decks made with cards from the latest 5 sets, as well as most Basic cards.
        This is an idea often found in popular games such as Magic: the Gathering or Hearthstone.
        Once the new set is out, Shadowverse will have over 1000 cards. The Set Rotation will keep the meta fresh, and make the game friendlier for new players.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-content">
            <h2 class="title"><em>The Rotation format will always feature only the <b>latest 5 sets</b>.</em></h2>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
        If you're attached to your collection, don't fret! <b>Unlimited</b> mode will allow all cards in the game. This is OK in theory, as
        it doesn't alienate veteran players, because it provides a game mode which rewards them for their knowledge of the game.
        However, what happens in other card games is that this "full" mode becomes a fringe area of the game, as most players tend to focus
        on the newest cards. I guess we'll have to wait and see how it plays out in Shadowverse.

    <h3>Tournament mode</h3>
    <p>Finally, Shadowverse will include an automated tournament mode, a feature sorely missing from other competitive card games. </p>
    <p>Tournaments are coming in 2018. "This will be an in-game tournament that anyone can join, regardless of rank. There will be preliminaries matches to determine which players make it to the finals to earn exclusive rewards."</p>
