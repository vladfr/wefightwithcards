    <p class="first">
        Kobolds and Catacombs is the latest Hearthstone expansion, launched on December 7. It features a sleuth of new cards that are bound to shake the meta.
    </p>
    <p>Among them are the new Legendary weapons, powerful one-of's that promise to bring back weapon-hate cards, and Spellstones, cards which get free upgrades as the match progresses. </p>
    <p>But I thought I'd take a look at the new Ladder staples: cards that you'll see time and again on the Ladder. You know, like <em>Bonemare</em>. </p>
    <p>We'll exclude Legendaries, since they're a one-off, and let's face it &mdash; you know that list will be just {{< card "Patches" "hs" >}} (yes, I know he's not a Kobold).</p>

<div class="content">

    <h3>5. Dragons</h3>
    <p>Dragon Priest just became stronger with the addition of a good board clear with a 3/3 body. Here's the Board Breaker extraordinaire &mdash; get ready to be sick of seeing 3 of these every match, courtesy of our old friend {{< card "Netherspite Historian" "hs">}}.</p>
    <div class="box card has-text-centered">
        <img src="/cards/hs/duskbreaker.png" />
        <p><small>Board Breaker</small></p>
    </div>

    <h3>4. Card draw</h3>
    <p>
        {{< card "Kobold Librarian" "hs">}} is a one drop which draws you a card when you play it. {{< card "Loot Hoarder" "hs" >}} sees play everywhere, so I fully expect to see
        this little guy in every Warlock deck ever. It fits perfectly into the Control Warlock strategy, and the 2 attack makes it relevant for Zoo as well.
    </p>
    <div class="box card has-text-centered">

    <h3>3. Flanking 2-for-1</h3>
    <p>Here's a card that's easy to spot: a removal spell that also gives you a body is rare to come by. This wolf fits perfectly into the new Spell Hunter archetype, but you'll be seeing it almost everywhere. </p>
    <div class="box card has-text-centered">
        <img src="/cards/hs/flanking%20strike.png" />
    </div>

    <h3>2. Exploding Secret</h3>
    <p>
        The new Mage secret was tearing up the ladder in the first days of Kobolds, and it's not showing any sign of letting up.
        {{< card "Explosive Runes" "hs">}} is exactly what Mage needed to close the gap: it offers both board control and a little damage at times &mdash; and with Jaina, every bit helps to get her opponent to that dangerous <em>below 10 health</em> zone, a.k.a <b>burn range</b>.
    </p>
    <div class="box card has-text-centered">
        <img src="/cards/hs/explosive runes.png" />
    </div>

    <h3>1. Shiny!</h3>
    <p>
        {{< card "Cavern Shinyfinder" "hs" >}} will only ever find one shiny weapon, and that's {{< card "Kingsbane" "hs" >}} &mdash; again and again and again.
    </p>
    <div class="box card has-text-centered">
        <img src="/cards/hs/cavern shinyfinder.png" />
    </div>

    <h3>0. Corridor Creeper</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Bonus!</b> Oh and such a great bonus it is! Minions that can be played for 0-mana always see play. I think {{< card "Corridor Creeper" "hs" >}} is the first one that fits an Aggro-style deck.
        So yes, we'll be sick of seeing it everywhere.
    </p>
