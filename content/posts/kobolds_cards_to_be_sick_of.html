    <p class="first">
        Kobolds and Catacombs is the latest Hearthstone expansion, launched on December 7. It features a sleuth of new cards that are bound to shake the meta.
    </p>
    <p>Among them are the new Legendary weapons, powerful one-of's that promise to bring back weapon-hate cards, and Spellstones, cards which get free upgrades as the match progresses. </p>
    <p>But I thought I'd take a look at the new Ladder staples: cards that you'll see time and again on the Ladder. You know, like <em>Bonemare</em>. </p>
    <p>We'll exclude Legendaries, since they're a one-off, and let's face it &mdash; you know that list will be just {{< card "Patches" "hs" >}}.</p>

    <h3>Dragons</h3>
    <p>Dragon Priest just became stronger with the addition of a good board clear with a 3/3 body. Here's Duskbreaker &mdash; I propose we call it Board Breaker.</p>

    <h3>Card draw</h3>
    <p>
        Kobold Librarian is a one drop which draws you a card when you play it. {{< card "Loot Hoarder" "hs" >}} sees play everywhere, so I fully expect to see
        this little guy in every Warlock deck ever. It fits perfectly into the Control Warlock strategy, and the 2 attack makes it relevant for Zoo as well.
