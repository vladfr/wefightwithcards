        In Entropia, a young star is born and chases its destiny among the suns and planets of the galaxy.
        Ending on Kickstarter this week, Entropia is a fresh card game with familiar mechanics and a friendly price.

    <h2>A star is born</h2>

    <p>Each player is a young star that is trying to form their very own planetary system in which to reside.
        The first person to control five planers wins the round, and the first player to reach 3 rounds wins.</p>

    <p>The game is rather small, at 54 cards total. But stategy is key &mdash; as each card can be used in different ways:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>you can keep the planet</li>
     <li>or you can discard and choose an effect on play</li>
     <li>and you can create combos</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other players will try to steal or even destroy your planets, so you'll need to get creative fast. Different actions and ways to combo ensure play variety, but also enable one strategy or another.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Who should play?</h2>
    <p>I find it's a great intro to more serious card games, because it has familiar concepts from other popular card games like Hearthstone or Magic.</p>
    <p>The cards allow you to draw &amp; discard, build a board state or attack an opponent, do combos and tempo swings. (yes, we're card nerds here!)</p>

    <div class="box">
        <figure class="image">
            <img src="/images/entropia/combo.jpg" />
        </figure>
    </div>

    <p>As you can see, you can have events like "When you attract a planet", which you can manipulate with another card &mdash; you'll be <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=ponder" target="_blank"><em>pondering</em></a> this play <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>.</p>

    <h2>Game modes</h2>

    <p>The game can be played with 2 to 6 players, although it's best when 4 people duke it out. There's also a <b>Teams</b> mode with 2v2 or 2v2v2, each team with their own mechanics and team strategies.</p>

    <p>What sounds really good for a game this size is the upcoming <em>Big Bad Boss Battle</em> mode which pits 2-3 players against 1 powerful star. This is reminiscent of Magic's Archenemy format, which I've always wanted to try, but never did it, since it requires special cards and rules.
        This game mode is still in testing and will be released as a free rule-book.</p>

    <h2>Special reveal</h2>

    <p>We also have a surprise for existing and future backers! Two new cards have been revealed. The first one highlights the choice aspect, present on a lot of cards.</p>

    <p>
        The second reveal is a little more cryptic! It's an unstable planet &mdash; can't wait to find out what this does!
