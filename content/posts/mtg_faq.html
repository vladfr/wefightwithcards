    <p>
        Closed Beta players won't be allowed to stream yet, but the devs are very active in the community. There's a great <a href="/posts/mtg-arena-intro#timeline">
        lineup of events</a> leading up to the launch, so check back often for updates.

    <p><strong>Where can I play?</strong></p>
    <p>
        MTG Arena will be <b>PC only in the beta</b>, because the devs need to iterate fast. They've built the game on a flexible engine, so they can easily expand to other platforms when it's ready.
        So this probably means mobile clients will be next.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Is this real MTG?</strong></p>
    <p>Short answer: YES! The beta will have the full Ixalan set. <a href="/posts/mtg-arena-intro/">See our article</a> for more details on what this means exactly.</p>

    <p><strong>So will it have trading?</strong></p>
    <p>Well, no. There's no trading involved. Arena is a free-to-play game where you gradually grow your card collection from packs. You can also buy packs for real money to unlock cards faster.

    <br>

    <p><strong>Does it replace Magic Online?</strong></p>
    <p>No. Arena will be a new game, focusing on Standard and Limited play (Drafting, or like Hearthstone's Arena). If you want to trade, or play with older Magic sets, Magic Online is the place for you. </p>

    <p><strong>Does it replace Duels?</strong></p>
    <p>No. This is an entirely new game. Duels was a watered-down version, focused on single-player and casual play.
    Magic will cater to this audience, but will also be perfect for pro-level play, streaming and eSports.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Will it have vanity items?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes. They want feedback from the community about what should be customizable.</p>

    <p><strong>What about foil cards? That's an obvious ask isn't it?</strong></p>
    <p>Very much so! But the devs haven't shared anything on this yet!</p>

    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-content">
            <h2 class="title"><em>They want <b>you</b> to play with the Standard decks from any Pro Tour.</em></h2>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p><strong>How do I get a Tier 1 deck?</strong></p>
    <p>The team is focused on allowing players to easily build their collection, up to a Tier 1 deck. They want you to have the Standard decks that you see in a Pro Tour.</p>

    <p><strong>How many creatures can be on the board at a time?</strong></p>
    <p>There was mention of a playtest game with 200 creatures at once (tokens) so that's the real Magic right there!</p>

    <p><strong>Any crazy digital-only modes?</strong></p>
    <p>There was a question about game modes unique to Arena as a digital game. They are not working on it &mdash; in fact, they're only thinking about it because the community mentioned it.
This really hints at the fact that they are fully committed to replicating Magic precisely, and don't want to stray from the true Magic feel.</p>
