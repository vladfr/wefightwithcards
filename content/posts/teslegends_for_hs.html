</p>

<p>Then look no further than <b>The Elder Scrolls: Legends</b>, the CCG set in the popular TES universe. The new <em>Skyrim</em> expansion is out and the skies are full of dragons, so there's no better time to join the fray!</p>

<p>This guide will get you started in no time. Since you're familiar with Hearthstone, we'll skip the beginner stuff and dive right into the most important details: main concepts, keywords, classes, crafting, game types and decks to play.</p>

<h4 class="title is-4">What's cool about TES:Legends?</h4>

<p>Right off the bat, Legends has a more serious tone than Hearthstone. If you love the high-stakes approach of Skyrim, you'll feel right at home. The single-player content is grim, there's a somber atmosphere, and dragons! Of course, the gameplay is still fun and has it's glorious moments &mdash; you'll have plenty of laughs in Skyrim.</p>

<h5 class="subtitle is-5">Gameplay</h5>

<p>The basic gameplay of Legends is identical to Hearthstone. The decks are bigger, but you still draw 3 cards with a mulligan, and you take turns playing creatures and spells. Your mana increases with 1 each turn. There's a ring &mdash; just like The Coin &mdash; and you get to use it 3 times (once per turn). You target the same way. There is no blocking phase and the only creatures that can keep you from hitting face have Guard (Taunt from Hearthstone).</p>

<p>Players start with 30 health. There are actions and abilities that restore health, and <strong>there is no maximum health<sup>*</sup></strong>: you can gain life over the starting 30.</p>

<p>
    <small><sup>*</sup> Actually, there is - it's 999 (same as any max stat, it seems). It doesn't have any practical relevance other than for the record's sake though.
    </small>
</p>

<h5 class="subtitle is-5">Combat Lanes</h5>

<p>The big difference in gameplay comes from the board. There are 2 lanes in Legends and creatures cannot attack between lanes. However, most abilities can be used anywhere.</p>

<p>The 2 lanes are not equal: creatures summoned in the <em>Shadow Lane</em> (the right-hand lane) have Hearthstone Stealth: they cannot be attacked for 1 turn after they are summoned. But unlike Stealth in Hearthstone, <strong>they can still be targeted by actions or summon abilities</strong>.
</p>

<p>The idea of 2 lanes plus the <em>Shadow Lane</em> will make most players sick with the idea of unchecked aggro. This is where the second big change to gameplay comes in: runes.</p>

<h5 class="subtitle is-5">Prophecy runes</h5>
<p>You start the game with 5 runes, which break at 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 health. When your health reaches one of these runes the rune breaks and you draw a card. Runes don’t regenerate.</p>

<p>The really interesting part is that there are <strong>Prophecy</strong> cards that can be played for free when you draw them off of a rune break. This mechanic changes the SMOrc meta considerably and you have to be careful about playing around runes. </p>

<p>Runes are also relevant in fatigue: if you run out of cards and draw dead, it breaks one of your runes. If you have no runes left, you die. Due to the decks being 50 cards, this happens less often than Hearthstone.</p>

        You get 30 life, 3 cards (4 if you go second) and you can <b>mulligan</b> once.

<h4 class="title is-4">Keywords</h4>

<p>Most keywords in Legends should be familiar to you:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ward = Divine Shield</li>
    <li>Guard = Taunt</li>
    <li>Lethal = Poison</li>
    <li>Charge = Charge</li>
    <li>Last Gasp = Deathrattle</li>
    <li>Silence = Silence (it’s rare, just as in HS)</li>
    <li>Slay = When this minion kills another minion.</li>
    <li>Shackle = Freeze</li>
    <li>Pilfer = Triggers when the minion deals damage to the face</li>
    <li>Regenerate creatures have all health restored at the start of your turn. This works like Stoneskin Gargoyle</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="subtitle is-5">Summon = like Battlecry</h5>
<p>
    Summon triggers when a card gets into play. It's usually present on creatures, but it can also be found on some Items.
    There's a big difference from Hearthstone: while Battlecry triggers when you play the card, Summon also triggers when a card is put into play by effects. Therefore, stuff like clone or revive effects are much more powerful in Legends. Summon can also target itself, so if a creature gives +1/+1 on Summon, it can give it to itself. Battlecry doesn't work like that at all!
</p>

<h5 class="subtitle is-5">Drain = Lifesteal</h5>
<p>
Damage dealt also heals you for the same amount. Three things you need to know about Drain.
    <li>Ward blocks all Drain as it counts as 0 damage.</li>
    <li>Drain creatures always drain their power value whether or not the creature you hit had that many HP. So if you hit a 2 HP creature with a 6 power drain you will heal for 6.</li>
    <li>drain creatures only drain on your turn!</li>
</p>


<h5 class="subtitle is-5">Breakthrough</h5>
<p>
<strong>Breakthrough</strong> is the same as trample from MTG but is missing from HS. It means that when the creature trades, any damage it can do over the current health of its target will hit face. So if you hit a 1 health enemy with a 4 power breakthrough creature it will kill the enemy creature with 1 health and do 3 damage to face.
</p>



<h4 class="title is-4">Cards and decks</h4>

<p>Legends has colours instead of classes. The rarities of cards are the same: common, rare, epic and legendary. One difference is that <strong>not all legendaries are unique</strong>: you can have up to 3 of <u>some</u> legendaries in a deck.</p>

<h5 class="subtitle is-5">Types of cards</h5>
<p>
    Legends has spells (Actions), minions (creatures) and weapons (Items), just like Hearthstone.</p>

<p>
    In addition, there are Support cards, which stay in play, and can be removed only with special Actions (much like Enchantments in Magic).
    And Item cards &mdash; magic objects or weapons you can equip on your creatures (like in Magic).
</p>

<p>Heroes of Skyrim contains five Shouts (one in each attribute), which are Actions that get stronger with each use. Shouts start each game at level 1, and after you play a Shout all of your copies of it upgrade to the next level (maxing out at level 3). As Shouts level up, their magicka costs stay the same but their effects get much more powerful. </p>

<p>One more thing to mention is that board clears in Legends are much more rare than in Hearthstone. Creatures may look underpowered, but the board is generally much more sticky than in Hearthstone, so minions can still be incredibly effective. However, single-target removal is still pretty powerful, so be warned!</p>


<h5 class="subtitle is-5">Deck construction</h5>

<p>Any deck can use cards from 2 colours as well as from the neutral card pool. You can also make single colour decks or even full neutral decks but you can't use more than 2 colours. The game has class names for all the 2 colour combinations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Red-blue: Battlemage</li>
    <li>Red-yellow: Crusader</li>
    <li>Red-green: Archer</li>
    <li>Red-purple: Warrior</li>
    <li>Blue-yellow: Mage</li>
    <li>Blue-green: Assassin</li>
    <li>Blue-purple: Sorcerer</li>
    <li>Yellow-green: Monk</li>
    <li>Yellow-Purple: Spellsword</li>
    <li>Purple-green: Scout</li>
</ul>


<p>Most cards have one colour. There are a few dual colour cards for every class.</p>

<p>What you see with this is that good cards get spread around to a lot more decks and the meta is generally more mutable. It also allows for creativity in deck construction.</p>

<p>Decks are 50 cards. Other than specific Unique Legendaries, you can have up to 3 of any card in your deck. Legends-decks.com is the best resource for finding deck ideas but you can often personalise or come up with decks that can be successful outside the established decks.</p>


<p>Those are the differences between Legends and Hearthstone. Now go forth and plunder!</p>
