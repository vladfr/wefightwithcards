    <p class="first">
        Hearthstone took the world by storm and gave new life to what seemed to be an established genre.
        The past few years saw a ton of big releases in the digital CCG genre, from new players such as Eternal, Shadowverse or Gwent, as well as
        big franchises such as Elder Scrolls: Legends.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now it's time for the big one. The one that started it all. Magic is finally entering the modern digital era.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content">
    <p>
        <b>MTG: Arena</b> is a fresh entry in a long-running franchise, and it's the first title in a new Digital initiative from publisher Wizards of the Coast.
        It's a Free-to-Play digital CCG where you battle it out online with the newest Magic cards and planeswalkers.
    </p>

    <h2>Magic old and new</h2>
    <p>
        Magic was already playable online &mdash; Magic Online first launched in 2002 and it's exactly like the tabletop version, trading included.
        But <b>Arena</b> is fully embracing the new digital landscape: built for quick play, with a ton of eye-candy for streaming, catering to both casual players and the eSports crowd, it promises an experience on par with other modern CCGs.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're new to Magic, then watch this space: Arena shapes up to be a great intro to this vast world.
    </p>

    {{< fotorama path="/static/images/mtg/gallery1" pathURL="/images/mtg/gallery1" >}}

    <h4 class="subtitle is-4">Gameplay</h4>

    <p>In many aspects, Arena is very much like Hearthstone and similar games: you build decks from a collection, get packs with real money or by just playing the game,
        and then duke it out in casual or competitive modes. There's promise of Draft gameplay as well as single-player content, but that's after Launch, sometime in 2018.
    </p>

    <p>
        Arena will have all cards from the tabletop set, and it will receive new cards at the same time with regular Magic releases.
        Right now, this means 4 sets per year with a total of over 1000 cards! Yes, that's a lot, but you should know what you're getting into!
    </p>

    <p>
        The beta will be PC only, but they're already thinking on how to bring it to mobile platforms.
    </p>

    <a name="cards"></a>
    <h2>Show me the cards already!</h2>

    <p>
        MTG: Arena will start Beta with all cards from the newest Magic set, Ixalan.
    </p>

    <p>The four peoples of <b>Ixalan</b> are locked in a deadly struggle as they search for the golden city of Orazca.</p>
    <p>The set features Pirates, Vampires, Merfolk, Dinosaurs, and 3 powerful planeswalkers.</p>
    <p>Ixalan also has double-faced cards: special Artifact and Enchantment cards which <em>Transform</em> into powerful Lands once certain conditions are met.</p>
    <p>sound good?</p>

    <h2>I know Magic &mdash; what should I expect?</h2>

    <p>
        People familiar with Magic gameplay will soon realize that Magic is far more complex than Hearthstone or other digital CCGs out there.
        Wizards has built a new Rules Engine just for this game. Supposedly, the rules engine can handle everything they throw at it, and can even
        figure out most new cards on its own. Now that's forward-thinking!
    </p>

    <figure class="image" style="width: 250px">
        <img src="/cards/mtg/jace cunning castaway.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
        This means that we will get full Magic, and not some watered-down version, like Duels. They have gone on record saying that
        you can totally build a pro-tour level deck, or that they've played a game with over 200 creatures on board (mostly tokens, but still impressive).
    </p>

    <p>
        Combine this with the fact that they'll have all Standard cards at launch, plus Draft mode, and potential tie-ins to the tabletop game and events like Friday Night Magic, and you get actual, real MTG. Can't wait!
    </p>

    <h4 class="subtitle is-4">How will Magic happen?</h4>
    <p>
        Just as you'd expect, you can manually tap for mana, tap cards, select attackers and blockers, get a chance to respond with Instants and abilities.
        You can also go on autopilot, and have the game do some of these things for you. The new Rules Engine is so smart that it can figure out when it needs to ping you for an action.
    </p>

    <figure class="image" style="width: 250px">
        <img src="/images/mtg/priest of the wakening sun.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>A good example is {{< card "Priest of the wakening sun" "mtg" >}}: every turn, you <em>may</em> reveal a Dinosaur card to gain 2 life. If you don't have a Dinosaur in your hand, the game won't ask you.
    </p>

    <a name="beta"></a>
    <h2>When can I play?</h2>
    <p>
