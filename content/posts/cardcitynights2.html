If you’re a fan of card games, you probably heard of Card City Nights by now. Released back in 2014, the quirky card game was a mash-up featuring characters from Ludosity’s other games, reimagined as card players. With an interesting core mechanic, stellar soundtrack and spiffy characters, the game was well-received and still provides a refreshing experience 3 years later. So naturally, fans are eagerly awaiting the sequel!
</p>

<p>The upcoming Card City Nights 2 launches September 1 on Steam. The game is familiar, yet new, with 200+ cards and some big changes to core mechanics. And, what's even more exciting, it brings a much-awaited feature: <strong>online multiplayer.</strong>

<p>CCN 2 combines traditional deck-building and card battle gameplay with a RPG-like story-line. You’re traveling aboard Starship Frivolity, where everyone’s favourite pastime is - you guessed it - playing cards! You battle zany characters in a quest to achieve fortune & glory. Oh, and collect all the cards! Then, you duke it out online with other players.</p>

<p>The core gameplay features an unique card chaining mechanic. Players seek to activate cards by linking their chain points. Once you link 3 cards, they resolve. When a card is resolved, it may trigger abilities, and then it leaves play.</p>

<p>That sounds simple, but it gets a lot more complex once you start playing. Factors such as card placement, timings, chain points and card abilities ensure a variety of tactics. The game promises a diverse metagame, close to the traditional aggro-combo-control scale of other CCGs.</p>

    <p>Developers <strong>Ludosity</strong> are tiny but strong: while just a small team of 6, they've been around for almost 10 years, and have over 20 published titles. They all feature an unique feel, "lighthearted and funny with a cartoony style".</p>

    <p>The team had a blast balancing the meta in their first multiplayer beta, which ended a few weeks ago. So I asked Joel Nyström to take a little time and give us some insight around the game, the beta and what to expect in multiplayer come September.</p>


<div class="interview">

    <ol>
        <li>
            <span>Vlad:</span> So Card City Nights 2 is out in September, excited about that?
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Joel:</span> Yes, very excited! The reception so far has been very good, and we have a lot more stuff to reveal yet =)
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Vlad:</span> Will we play a much different game at launch, than now in the beta?
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Joel:</span> The multiplayer matches will not change significantly from what you saw in the beta, except for improved menus and UX. However there's also the whole single-player adventure that we haven't revealed yet!
        </li>

        <li>
            <span>V:</span> Multiplayer is very much anticipated, at least judging from the player activity in the beta.
            What were the challenges to create a multiplayer component to Card City Nights?
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>J:</span> The original CCN was probably not very balanced for competitive play, I think some cards were simply just better than others in that game. Because it was only a single-player adventure, we balanced it according to a difficulty curve that fit with the story arch. With CCN2 we try to balance the cards so that there will be no dominant strategies and every card can fill a useful role in a deck.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span>V:</span> We definitely saw better balance in the mp beta. Speaking of, was there a meta-game already forming?
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>J:</span> The community would often post on the forums what decks/strategies they perceived as dominant, but the dominant strategies changed several times over a short 10-day period, and looking at the stats, the numbers aren't quite showing the same picture! So balancing the meta is something that's going extremely interesting once the game is live.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span>V:</span> How different is it to test it with real players, versus just an internal test group? Was there a lot of unexpected stuff happening?
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>J:</span> We did the beta precisely to be on stand-by to quickly fix as many things as we could during the 10-day beta. It was a lot of fun, and very intense! Working live against an audience is a blast!
        </li>

        <li>
            <span>V:</span> Any critical balance changes that you've identified in the beta?
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>J:</span> Yes, in the initial version we might have gone a little too far with the unusual and weird mechanics, while neglecting the core mechanic of connecting chains. This was re-balanced during the beta.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span>V:</span> Will we see some single-player content closer to launch?
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>J:</span> There won't be any more betas before launch now, but we'll start revealing more of the adventure in trailers, screenshots and blog-posts soon! Also, catch us at <em>Gamescom in Cologne</em> this August and I'll personally show you =)
        </li>

With all that in mind, multiplayer should be a total blast! The last beta gave us a taste. Focused on multiplayer, beta #2 was open to 1000 players, who quickly generated a meta that shifted quite a bit during the course of the event. As a result, the devs released a couple of balance changes in short succession.

            Princess Remedy proved to be a great control card
        </span>
    </div>

<p>
I loved the fact that new decks emerged every day: at first, the Frog deck ruled. Then, players started countering it with control decks, then by using the best princess there is: {{< card "Princess Remedy">}}. In the last few days, people noticed that a fatigue archetype is a contender for "top deck". This can only mean good news for the finished game &mdash; everyone wants a dynamic meta with multiple deck types to explore.
