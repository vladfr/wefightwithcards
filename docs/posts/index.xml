      <description>If you’re a fan of card games, you probably heard of Card City Nights by now. Released back in 2014, the quirky card game was a mash-up featuring characters from Ludosity’s other games, reimagined as card players. With an interesting core mechanic, stellar soundtrack and spiffy characters, the game was well-received and still provides a refreshing experience 3 years later. So naturally, fans are eagerly awaiting the sequel! The upcoming Card City Nights 2 launches September 1 on Steam.</description>
