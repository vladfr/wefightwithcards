      <title>A guide to Elder Scrolls: Legends for Hearthstone players</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;small&gt;original article by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/user/Karandor&#34;&gt;/u/Karandor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Do you need a break from Hearthstone? Is the SmOrC too much? Does the Lich King put you off &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5VWb4i_BwM&#34;&gt;with his icy puns&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then look no further than &lt;b&gt;The Elder Scrolls: Legends&lt;/b&gt;, the CCG set in the popular TES universe. The new &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; expansion is out and the skies are full of dragons, so there&#39;s no better time to join the fray!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide will get you started in no time. Since you&#39;re familiar with Hearthstone, we&#39;ll skip the beginner stuff and dive right into the most important details: main concepts, keywords, classes, crafting, game types and decks to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick jumps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;tag is-info&#34;&gt;Pro tip:&lt;/span&gt; You can bookmark this page and come back to it for the quick reference cards.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4 class=&#34;title is-4&#34;&gt;What&#39;s cool about TES:Legends?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right off the bat, Legends has a more serious tone than Hearthstone. If you love the high-stakes approach of Skyrim, you&#39;ll feel right at home. The single-player content is grim, there&#39;s a somber atmosphere, and dragons! Of course, the gameplay is still fun and has it&#39;s glorious moments &amp;mdash; you&#39;ll have plenty of laughs in Skyrim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 class=&#34;subtitle is-5&#34;&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic gameplay of Legends is identical to Hearthstone. The decks are bigger, but you still draw 3 cards with a mulligan, and you take turns playing creatures and spells. Your mana increases with 1 each turn. There&#39;s a ring &amp;mdash; just like The Coin &amp;mdash; and you get to use it 3 times (once per turn). You target the same way. There is no blocking phase and the only creatures that can keep you from hitting face have Guard (Taunt from Hearthstone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players start with 30 health. There are actions and abilities that restore health, and &lt;strong&gt;there is no maximum health&lt;/strong&gt;: you can gain life over the starting 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 class=&#34;subtitle is-5&#34;&gt;Combat Lanes&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big difference in gameplay comes from the board. There are 2 lanes in Legends and creatures cannot attack between lanes. However, most abilities can be used anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2 lanes are not equal: creatures summoned in the &lt;em&gt;Shadow Lane&lt;/em&gt; (the right-hand lane) have Hearthstone Stealth: they cannot be attacked for 1 turn after they are summoned. But unlike Stealth in Hearthstone, &lt;strong&gt;they can still be targeted by actions or summon abilities&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of 2 lanes plus the &lt;em&gt;Shadow Lane&lt;/em&gt; will make most players sick with the idea of unchecked aggro. This is where the second big change to gameplay comes in: runes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 class=&#34;subtitle is-5&#34;&gt;Prophecy runes&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start the game with 5 runes, which break at 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 health. When your health reaches one of these runes the rune breaks and you draw a card. Runes don’t regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really interesting part is that there are &lt;strong&gt;Prophecy&lt;/strong&gt; cards that can be played for free when you draw them off of a rune break. This mechanic changes the SMOrc meta considerably and you have to be careful about playing around runes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Runes are also relevant in fatigue: if you run out of cards and draw dead, it breaks one of your runes. If you have no runes left, you die. Due to the decks being 50 cards, this happens less often than Hearthstone.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4 class=&#34;title is-4&#34;&gt;Keywords&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most keywords in Legends should be familiar to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ward = Divine Shield&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Guard = Taunt&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Lethal = Poison&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Charge = Charge&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Last Gasp = Deathrattle&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Silence = Silence (it’s rare, just as in HS)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Slay = When this minion kills another minion.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Shackle = Freeze&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pilfer = Triggers when the minion deals damage to the face&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Regenerate creatures have all health restored at the start of your turn. This works like Stoneskin Gargoyle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Summon = like Battlecry&lt;br/&gt;
    Summon triggers when a card gets into play. It&#39;s usually present on creatures, but it can also be found on some Items.
    There&#39;s a big difference from Hearthstone: while Battlecry triggers when you play the card, Summon also triggers when a card is put into play by effects. Therefore, stuff like clone or revive effects are much more powerful in Legends. Summon can also target itself, so if a creature gives +1/+1 on Summon, it can give it to itself. Battlecry doesn&#39;t work like that at all!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drain = Lifesteal &lt;br/&gt;
Damage dealt also heals you for the same amount. Three things you need to know about Drain.
    &lt;li&gt;Ward blocks all Drain as it counts as 0 damage.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Drain creatures always drain their power value whether or not the creature you hit had that many HP. So if you hit a 2 HP creature with a 6 power drain you will heal for 6.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;drain creatures only drain on your turn!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Breakthrough&lt;/strong&gt; is the same as trample from MTG but is missing from HS. It means that when the creature trades, any damage it can do over the current health of its target will hit face. So if you hit a 1 health enemy with a 4 power breakthrough creature it will kill the enemy creature with 1 health and do 3 damage to face.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class=&#34;title is-4&#34;&gt;Cards and decks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legends has colours instead of classes. The rarities of cards are the same: common, rare, epic and legendary. One difference is that &lt;strong&gt;not all legendaries are unique&lt;/strong&gt;: you can have up to 3 of &lt;u&gt;some&lt;/u&gt; legendaries in a deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 class=&#34;subtitle is-5&#34;&gt;Types of cards&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Legends has spells (Actions), minions (creatures) and weapons (Items), just like Hearthstone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    In addition, there are Support cards, which stay in play, and can be removed only with special Actions (much like Enchantments in Magic).
    And Item cards &amp;mdash; magic objects or weapons you can equip on your creatures (like in Magic).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroes of Skyrim contains five Shouts (one in each attribute), which are Actions that get stronger with each use. Shouts start each game at level 1, and after you play a Shout all of your copies of it upgrade to the next level (maxing out at level 3). As Shouts level up, their magicka costs stay the same but their effects get much more powerful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing to mention is that board clears in Legends are much more rare than in Hearthstone. Creatures may look underpowered, but the board is generally much more sticky than in Hearthstone, so minions can still be incredibly effective. However, single-target removal is still pretty powerful, so be warned!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h5 class=&#34;subtitle is-5&#34;&gt;Deck construction&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any deck can use cards from 2 colours as well as from the neutral card pool. You can also make single colour decks or even full neutral decks but you can&#39;t use more than 2 colours. The game has class names for all the 2 colour combinations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Red-blue: Battlemage&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Red-yellow: Crusader&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Red-green: Archer&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Red-purple: Warrior&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Blue-yellow: Mage&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Blue-green: Assassin&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Blue-purple: Sorcerer&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Yellow-green: Monk&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Yellow-Purple: Spellsword&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Purple-green: Scout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Most cards have one colour. There are a few dual colour cards for every class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you see with this is that good cards get spread around to a lot more decks and the meta is generally more mutable. It also allows for creativity in deck construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decks are 50 cards. Other than specific Unique Legendaries, you can have up to 3 of any card in your deck. Legends-decks.com is the best resource for finding deck ideas but you can often personalise or come up with decks that can be successful outside the established decks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those are the differences between Legends and Hearthstone. Now go forth and plunder!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Welcome to Frivolity</title>
      <link>https://wefightwithcards.com/posts/card-city-nights-Ludosity-interview-multiplayer/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2017 23:48:45 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wefightwithcards.com/posts/card-city-nights-Ludosity-interview-multiplayer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;article&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you’re a fan of card games, you probably heard of Card City Nights by now. Released back in 2014, the quirky card game was a mash-up featuring characters from Ludosity’s other games, reimagined as card players. With an interesting core mechanic, stellar soundtrack and spiffy characters, the game was well-received and still provides a refreshing experience 3 years later. So naturally, fans are eagerly awaiting the sequel!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upcoming Card City Nights 2 launches September 1 on Steam. The game is familiar, yet new, with 200+ cards and some big changes to core mechanics. And, what&#39;s even more exciting, it brings a much-awaited feature: &lt;strong&gt;online multiplayer.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;box has-text-centered&#34;&gt;
        &lt;figure class=&#34;image&#34;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&#34;https://wefightwithcards.com/images/cardcitynights/card-city-nights-board.png&#34; /&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;small&#34;&gt;
            Players will place cards on the same game board.
        &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCN 2 combines traditional deck-building and card battle gameplay with a RPG-like story-line. You’re traveling aboard Starship Frivolity, where everyone’s favourite pastime is - you guessed it - playing cards! You battle zany characters in a quest to achieve fortune &amp; glory. Oh, and collect all the cards! Then, you duke it out online with other players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core gameplay features an unique card chaining mechanic. Players seek to activate cards by linking their chain points. Once you link 3 cards, they resolve. When a card is resolved, it may trigger abilities, and then it leaves play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounds simple, but it gets a lot more complex once you start playing. Factors such as card placement, timings, chain points and card abilities ensure a variety of tactics. The game promises a diverse metagame, close to the traditional aggro-combo-control scale of other CCGs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;box has-text-centered&#34;&gt;
        &lt;figure class=&#34;image card&#34;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&#34;https://wefightwithcards.com/ccn/Potato.png&#34; /&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;small&#34;&gt;
            The Potato &amp;mdash; #1 card in the beta
        &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;divider&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Developers &lt;strong&gt;Ludosity&lt;/strong&gt; are tiny but strong: while just a small team of 6, they&#39;ve been around for almost 10 years, and have over 20 published titles. They all feature an unique feel, &#34;lighthearted and funny with a cartoony style&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The team had a blast balancing the meta in their first multiplayer beta, which ended a few weeks ago. So I asked Joel Nyström to take a little time and give us some insight around the game, the beta and what to expect in multiplayer come September.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;interview&#34;&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;Vlad:&lt;/span&gt; So Card City Nights 2 is out in September, excited about that?
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;Joel:&lt;/span&gt; Yes, very excited! The reception so far has been very good, and we have a lot more stuff to reveal yet =)
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;Vlad:&lt;/span&gt; Will we play a much different game at launch, than now in the beta?
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;Joel:&lt;/span&gt; The multiplayer matches will not change significantly from what you saw in the beta, except for improved menus and UX. However there&#39;s also the whole single-player adventure that we haven&#39;t revealed yet!
        &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;V:&lt;/span&gt; Multiplayer is very much anticipated, at least judging from the player activity in the beta.
            What were the challenges to create a multiplayer component to Card City Nights?
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;J:&lt;/span&gt; The original CCN was probably not very balanced for competitive play, I think some cards were simply just better than others in that game. Because it was only a single-player adventure, we balanced it according to a difficulty curve that fit with the story arch. With CCN2 we try to balance the cards so that there will be no dominant strategies and every card can fill a useful role in a deck.
        &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;V:&lt;/span&gt; We definitely saw better balance in the mp beta. Speaking of, was there a meta-game already forming?
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;J:&lt;/span&gt; The community would often post on the forums what decks/strategies they perceived as dominant, but the dominant strategies changed several times over a short 10-day period, and looking at the stats, the numbers aren&#39;t quite showing the same picture! So balancing the meta is something that&#39;s going extremely interesting once the game is live.
        &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;V:&lt;/span&gt; How different is it to test it with real players, versus just an internal test group? Was there a lot of unexpected stuff happening?
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;J:&lt;/span&gt; We did the beta precisely to be on stand-by to quickly fix as many things as we could during the 10-day beta. It was a lot of fun, and very intense! Working live against an audience is a blast!
        &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;V:&lt;/span&gt; Any critical balance changes that you&#39;ve identified in the beta?
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;J:&lt;/span&gt; Yes, in the initial version we might have gone a little too far with the unusual and weird mechanics, while neglecting the core mechanic of connecting chains. This was re-balanced during the beta.
        &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;V:&lt;/span&gt; Will we see some single-player content closer to launch?
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;J:&lt;/span&gt; There won&#39;t be any more betas before launch now, but we&#39;ll start revealing more of the adventure in trailers, screenshots and blog-posts soon! Also, catch us at &lt;em&gt;Gamescom in Cologne&lt;/em&gt; this August and I&#39;ll personally show you =)
        &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;divider&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With all that in mind, multiplayer should be a total blast! The last beta gave us a taste. Focused on multiplayer, beta #2 was open to 1000 players, who quickly generated a meta that shifted quite a bit during the course of the event. As a result, the devs released a couple of balance changes in short succession.
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;box is-pulled-right has-text-centered&#34; style=&#34;width: 250px&#34;&gt;
        &lt;figure class=&#34;image&#34;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&#34;https://wefightwithcards.com/ccn/Princess Remedy.png&#34; /&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;small&#34;&gt;
            Princess Remedy proved to be a great control card
        &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I loved the fact that new decks emerged every day: at first, the Frog deck ruled. Then, players started countering it with control decks, then by using the best princess there is: 
&lt;strong class=&#34;game-card&#34; data-html=&#34;true&#34; data-toggle=&#34;popover&#34; data-placement=&#34;right&#34;
